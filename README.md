# HPC_Project
21 Class classification using CNN and Transfer learning and increasing performance using a gpu

Dataset can be downloaded form http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html




The HPC_CNN_DROPOUT_reg.py contains the code.Change the paramertes like location of dataset and location for saving and loading the weights file(.h5)
After that just run the code.'it contains the following sections
Libraries
VGG19 model
Preprocessing
Predicting the Output
Saving and loading the weights

Output.out cantains the the training Output with accuracy
There are Graphs for loss and accuracy


HPC_Report is the Presentation for the Project.
